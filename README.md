scripts
=======
My scripts for everyday use.

Currently hosting:

* `gto` - it opens any local remote's GitHub repo in the default browser
* `gtr` - assuming your remote is called `origin` and is a fork, it compares the master repo with the current branch (also opens in the browser)

Both scripts require the `git` gem, so make sure to run `$ [sudo] gem install git` before using them.

Contribute!
=======
Yon can contribute to this repo with any scripts that I will find useful.
