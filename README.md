scripts
=======
My scripts for everyday use.

Currently hosting:

* `gto` - open any local remote's GitHub repo
* `gtr` - assuming your remote is called origin and is a fork, compare the master repo with the current branch (also opens GitHub page in your browser)

Both scripts require the `git` gem, so make sure to run `$ [sudo] gem install git` before using them.

Contribute!
=======
Yon can contribute to this repo with any scripts that I will find useful.
